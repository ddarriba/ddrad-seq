input.R

Input files: %.loci - file containing data for each locus
             taxa - file containing the names of all taxa in the loci file

From R:

  # STEP 1: load the script file

  source("input.R")
  
  # STEP 2: call read.loci function to read the %.loci file

  all_loci = read.loci("LOCI_FILENAME")

  # STEP 3: build the filter according to a minimum number of unique sequences, variable and parsimony informative sites
  # Note: min_var = -1 or min_inf = -1 means log2(number_of_taxa) for each locus instead of a fixed amount
  
  snp_filter = snp.filter(all_loci, min_taxa, min_var, min_inf)
  
  # STEP 4: call snp.select to select one SNP per locus.
  # there are 3 score functions:
  #   snp.score.first      : selects the first SNP
  #   snp.score.nonmissing : selects the first SNP with the fewest missing characters
  #   snp.score.all        : penalizes both missing data and heterozigous characters (and other ambiguities)

  snp_list = snp.select(all_loci, snp.score.nonmissing)
  
  # STEP 5: call snp.mat to build the snp matrix.
  # OPTIONALLY you can add the filter built in step 3

  snp_matrix <- snp.mat(snp_list, snp_filter)

  # STEP 6: apply the same filter to the loci matrix
  
  loci_matrix <- loci.mat(loci_list, snp_filter)
    
  # STEP 7: dump the SNP MSA in "fasta" or "phylip" format
  
  write.msa(snp_matrix, "OUTPUT_FILENAME", "fasta") 
  
  # STEP 8: dump the loci matrix according to the SNP filter

  write.msa(loci_matrix,  "OUTPUT_FILENAME", "fasta")
