input.R

Input files: %.loci - file containing data for each locus
             taxa - file containing the names of all taxa in the loci file

From R:

  # STEP 1: load the script file

  source("input.R")
  
  # STEP 2: call read.loci function to read the %.loci file

  all_loci = read.loci("LOCI_FILENAME")
  
  # STEP 3: call snp.select to select one SNP per locus.
  # there are 3 score functions:
  #   snp.score.first      : selects the first SNP
  #   snp.score.nonmissing : selects the first SNP with the fewest missing characters
  #   snp.score.all        : penalizes both missing data and heterozigous characters (and other ambiguities)

  snplist = snp.select(all_loci, snp.score.nonmissing)
  
  # STEP 4: call snp.mat to build the snp matrix (also applies a min_taxa filter, 3 by default). Requires the taxa file

  snpmatrix <- snp.mat(snplist, "TAXA_FILENAME", 4)
  
  # STEP 5: dump the SNP MSA in "fasta" or "phylip" format
  
  snp.dumpmatrix(snpmatrix, "OUTPUT_FILENAME", "fasta")
