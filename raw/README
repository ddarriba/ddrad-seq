- The process scripts were written such that they are effective but not
  necessarily efficient since they only need to run once and there is no
  hurry at all. Hence, sit down and relax while the data is processed.

- Albinaria RAW data

  Data files:
    %.alleles         Per-locus allele data
    %.excluded_loci   Initial excluded loci
    %.geno
    %.loci            Per-locus MSAs
    %.nex             Supermatrix in NEXUS
    %.phy             Supermatrix in PHYLIP
    %.snps            Supermatrix with SNPs only
                      Includes '_' as loci separator
    %.str             Unknown
    %.unlinked_snps   SNPs in PHYLIP
    %.vcf             VCF file

    %.loci.head       Per-locus headers

    ./loci
      ./i             One thousand loci (i = j/1000)
        %.locus.j     MSA for locus j

  Summary files:
    taxa        List of taxa
    taxa.desc   Taxa statistics
    loci.desc   Loci statistics

  Scripts:

    initial_process.sh  Creates the loci headers file and taxa names files

    split_loci.sh     Creates and populates the 'loci' directory structure
      Input: Albinaria98inds_c91d6m4p3.loci
      Output: Per-locus MSAs in 'loci' directory
      
    gather_info.sh    Creates the loci description file
      Input: per-locus files (loci directory)
      Output: loci.desc
      Warning... this script may take a long time to run!

    map_taxa.sh       Maps the taxa per-locus (order as in 'taxa' file)
      Input: Albinaria98inds_c91d6m4p3.loci.head
      Output: Map of taxa per-locus (1: present 0: absent)
